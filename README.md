# `DEVELOPMENT-WITH-SWIFT-EXPLORATIONS`

I started by exploring the fundamental concepts of programming in Swift and understood the impact that apps have on society and culture. The study units were divided into four parts: values, algorithms, data organization, and app building. In the first unit, I gained knowledge about how values, such as text and numbers, flow through my code and how to assign names to them using variables. In the second unit, I delved into code structure, learning to use functions to automate repetitive tasks and make decisions with if/else statements. The third unit focused on data organization, where I learned to create custom types with structures, group data into arrays, and process it with loops. Additionally, I explored how enumerations represent related sets of values. The culmination of this stage was creating an interactive game with colorful shapes. Finally, in the fourth unit, I solidified my app-building skills from scratch using Xcode and Interface Builder. I learned to design user interfaces, connect elements to my code, and respond to user interactions.

## `Lesson 4.3 - Create an ElementQuiz App`

### `E-Build an ElementQuiz App`

This code is a chemical element study app that offers two study modes (flashcard and quiz) and provides an interactive user interface to help the user learn and assess their knowledge. The app's logic and user interface are managed comprehensively, and the code includes functions to set up new study sessions based on the user's chosen mode.
