# DEVELOPMENT-WITH-SWIFT-EXPLORATIONS

I started by exploring the fundamental concepts of programming in Swift and understood the impact that apps have on society and culture. The study units were divided into four parts: values, algorithms, data organization, and app building. In the first unit, I gained knowledge about how values, such as text and numbers, flow through my code and how to assign names to them using variables. In the second unit, I delved into code structure, learning to use functions to automate repetitive tasks and make decisions with if/else statements. The third unit focused on data organization, where I learned to create custom types with structures, group data into arrays, and process it with loops. Additionally, I explored how enumerations represent related sets of values. The culmination of this stage was creating an interactive game with colorful shapes. Finally, in the fourth unit, I solidified my app-building skills from scratch using Xcode and Interface Builder. I learned to design user interfaces, connect elements to my code, and respond to user interactions.
