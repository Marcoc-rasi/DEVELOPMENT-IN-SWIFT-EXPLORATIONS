# Building Apps

In this unit, you will deepen your skills in Xcode and Interface Builder through guided projects, where you'll learn to build an app from the ground up. The projects will guide you in adding user interface elements, connecting them to code, and handling user interaction events. Incremental development will be emphasized, allowing you to expand your app's capabilities gradually and test it at each phase.
