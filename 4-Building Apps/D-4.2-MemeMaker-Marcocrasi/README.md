# MemeMaker
## Introduction
Youâ€™re going to build an app that lets you add fun captions to a photo. This is another opportunity to practice the Xcode and Swift skills you've learned throughout this course. The final app will look something like this

Selecting any one of the emoji will change the text above and below its image, so you can mix and match statements to suit your mood.

The code begins by importing the UIKit module, which provides the necessary classes and functions for developing iOS applications.

Next, it defines the class `ViewController`, which inherits from `UIViewController`. This inheritance signifies that this class will act as a view controller in the application's view hierarchy.

Within the class, several UI properties and objects are created, which are connected to UI elements in the corresponding view interface file, likely a .xib or .storyboard file. These elements include:

- `topSegmentedControl` and `bottomSegmentedControl`: Two `UISegmentedControl` objects that allow the user to select options for the top and bottom portions of a meme.

- `topCaptionLabel` and `bottomCaptionLabel`: Two `UILabel` objects that will display the meme captions at the top and bottom of the meme image.

Two arrays, `topChoices` and `bottomChoices, are defined to store instances of the `CaptionOption` structure. Each array contains options for meme captions along with related emojis.

The `viewDidLoad()` method is responsible for configuring the UI elements and setting the initial text of the UILabel elements based on the selection made in the `UISegmentedControl`. It also performs the following actions:

- Removes previous segments in the segmented controls using `removeAllSegments()`.

- Then, it inserts new segments into the controls using the information stored in the `topChoices` and `bottomChoices` arrays.

The `segmentedControlValueChanged(_:)` method is triggered when the user changes the selection in one of the segmented controls. Depending on whether the top or bottom segmented control sends the action, `changeLabelChoice` is called to update the corresponding caption.

The `dragTopLabel(_:)` and `dragBottomLabel(_:)` methods allow dragging the top and bottom caption labels when the user performs a dragging gesture.

The `changeLabelChoice(segmentedControl:label:choices:)` method updates the text of the corresponding label with the selected caption from the segmented control.

In summary, this code is part of a meme creation application that enables users to select emojis and captions for the top and bottom parts of an image and view the resulting meme.
