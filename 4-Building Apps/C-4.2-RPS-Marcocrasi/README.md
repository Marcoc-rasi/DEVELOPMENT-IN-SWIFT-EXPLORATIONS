# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## What You’ll Build
A Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

## What You’ll Learn
- How to build game logic using the skills you've learned so far in this course.
- How to apply the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern in your code.

## Key Vocabulary
- `Model-View-Controller`: A design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller.
- `Random Number`: A number generated by a process that cannot be predicted and is typically used in games for unpredictability.

 
# Introduction
Think back to your first coding lessons in this course. You’ve come a long way from counting animals at a pet show!
In previous lessons, the focus has been on learning new things: programming topics in Swift, and app-building topics in Xcode and​ Interface Builder. Here, you'll focus on using what you’ve learned to create an​ app from scratch. The instructions you'll be following are less detailed, which will challenge you to recall all your skills and knowledge.

The game you're building is Rock, Paper, Scissors. If you haven’t heard of the game, it works like this:

- Two players face each other.
- On the count of three, they both make a sign, at the exact same time, with one hand. The sign is either a rock (closed fist), paper (open palm), or scissors (two fingers, open like the victory sign).
- Each sign can beat one (and only one) other:
    - Rock smashes scissors.
    - Scissors cut paper.
    - Paper covers rock.

If both players choose the same sign, the game is a draw.

In the game you’ll build, your opponent will be the app itself, so you won’t need to count to three. To play the game, you’ll tap one of the three signs: Rock, Paper, or Scissors (first image).
The app will randomly choose a responding sign and show the results (image below).

In the game you’ll build, your opponent will be the app itself, so you won’t need to count to three. To play the game, you’ll tap one of the three signs: Rock, Paper, or Scissors (first image).
The app will randomly choose a responding sign and show the results (second image).

You'll use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to make this app. The purpose of MVC is to separate the parts of your app, giving clearly defined responsibilities to each part. That way, you'll keep your code easy to read and easy to think about. MVC is the default pattern used natively in the iOS SDK, Cocoa Touch; and consequently many (or most) iOS developers follow this pattern.
Recall that you've already seen the value of separation between different app components in QuestionBot and Chatbot. You worked on a brain and a data source that had a focused set of tasks that they performed, which enabled you to create a functioning app without touching the rest of the project. You also worked on connecting UI elements, such as switches, to your controller code in the ColorMix app.
You’ll build the game logic (the model) first, followed by the UI (the view). Then you’ll put the two together with the controller. By now you’ve learned everything you need to build the app on your own. So you won’t get step-by-step guidance, just an outline of what you should do to make the game work.

Implementation of a **"Rock, Paper, Scissors"** game application in Swift, using the UIKit user interface for iOS. This application consists of three main parts: the `GameState.swift` file, the `Sign.swift` file, and the `ViewController.swift` file.

**GameState.swift** defines an enumeration named `GameState`, representing the possible states of the game. These states are **"Start"** (beginning), **"Victory"** (win), **"Lose"** (loss), and **"Tie"** (draw). Each state has a `stateDescription` property that provides a human-readable description.

**Sign.swift** contains the definition of the `Sign` enumeration, representing the three game options: **"Scissors,"** **"Rock,"** and **"Paper."** Each option has a corresponding **emoji** and a `gameResult` method that determines the game's outcome based on the player's and opponent's choices.

In **ViewController.swift**, you'll find the `ViewController` class, which handles the application's user interface. Interface elements such as labels and buttons are connected to properties within the class. The `viewDidLoad` function initializes the user interface when the view loads, and button event-handling methods allow the player to make their choice and restart the game.

The `updateUI` function updates the user interface based on the game's state, changing the background color and showing/hiding buttons as necessary. Additionally, it displays the current game state and the opponent's emoji.

The `play` method represents the game logic. It takes the player's choice, generates a random choice for the opponent, and calculates the game's result using the `gameResult` method. Then, it updates the user interface with the result and displays the opponent's emoji. Finally, it disables the player's choice buttons and shows the "Play Again" button to allow the player to restart the game.

Collectively, this code provides a complete gaming experience for "Rock, Paper, Scissors" on an iOS application, with visual representations of the choices, status messages, and functionality for playing and restarting. The application uses emojis and background colors to enhance the gaming experience.
