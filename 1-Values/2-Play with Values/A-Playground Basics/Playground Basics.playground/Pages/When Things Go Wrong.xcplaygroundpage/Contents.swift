## When Things Go Wrong ðŸ˜°
Programmers make mistakes.\
(More often than you might imagine.)

As you write code and build apps, you'll make mistakes too.

_Donâ€™t panic._

Sometimes things go wrong when writing code. This is totally normal.\
Donâ€™t expect everything to come together without errors.

Troubleshooting when things go wrong is part of programming.

The first step is not to freak out. Take a deep breath.

_Donâ€™t panic._

An error doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™ve failed or youâ€™re a bad programmer.\
It just means thereâ€™s a problem in the code and you need to fix it.

It's all part of the process.
