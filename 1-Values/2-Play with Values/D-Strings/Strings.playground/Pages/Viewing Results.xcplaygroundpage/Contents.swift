## Viewing Playground Results
What if you define a long string in a playground? You‚Äôll notice that the longer string is cut off at the end in the results sidebar. üëâ

let spelledOutNumber = "six"
let meal = "breakfast"
let aliceQuotation = "Why, sometimes I‚Äôve believed as many as \(spelledOutNumber) impossible things before \(meal)!"
/*:
No worries. In the results sidebar, move the cursor over the line that begins ‚ÄúWhy, sometimes I‚Äôve believed‚Ä¶‚Äù When you do, that result will be highlighted and two controls will appear:

![Sidebar Controls](SidebarControls.png)
Click the control that looks like an eye. This is the _Quick Look button_. It displays a popover with more of the string value.

Move the cursor over the control that looks like an outlined rectangle. This is the _show result_ button. Click it to add the result of that line of code directly below the code. Click this control again to hide the result.
 
There's a third way you can see more of a result in your playground. Mouse over the divider between the editor and the results sidebar until the cursor turns into a left-pointing arrow attached to a vertical line:

![resize cursor](resize-cursor.png)

Then click and drag that edge to the left. You can expand the results sidebar as much as you want.
 
Now drag it as far as you can to the right. You can collapse the results sidebar to a minimal width so that it contains only the two buttons for displaying results. That maximizes the area you have for editing code.
 
 On the next page, learn another way you can view data that you create in a playground.
