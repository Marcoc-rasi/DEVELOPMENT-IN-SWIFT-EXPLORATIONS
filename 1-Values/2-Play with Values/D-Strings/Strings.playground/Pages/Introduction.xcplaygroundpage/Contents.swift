## Strings
Look at just about any app and you'll see text — on messaging apps, news readers, social media, maps — you name it. Even camera apps might use text to label buttons and controls.

In most programming languages, including Swift, text values are called _strings_.

### Why "Strings"?
Imagine a string of beads. Each bead may look completely unique, but they’re all strung together in a particular order.

A single letter (for example, an “H”) isn't usually meaningful by itself. But a string of letters can create a word, so programmers call text a _string_. And a string can be just about any text imaginable.
