## Simulating the Natural Environment
 
 You can use code to explore the world around you. An ant colony is a very complex system that displays well-defined behaviors. For instance, it disposes of waste in a particular location. It also forages for and exploits food sources with coordinated activity. Once a food source is discovered, many ants converge on it to carry the food back to the colony nest.
 
 Emergent behavior is one interesting aspect of the natural world â€” it's found in all kinds of systems. Ant colonies are characterized by emergent behavior because individual ants don't have any global knowledge about the colony. The complexity of a colony emerges from the combination of lots of ants all following simple local rules.
 
 This playground contains a simple model of an ant colony that searches for food and returns it to the nest. Over the next few pages you'll become familiar with the model and its behavior, and learn how to modify that behavior by setting values for the parameters of the simulation.
