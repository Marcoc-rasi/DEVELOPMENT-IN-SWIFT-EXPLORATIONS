## Pet Problem Recap
After you’ve made all the updates, the playground should look something like this:
 */
// Number Of Dogs
6

// Number Of Cats
5

// Number Of Turtles
2

// Number Of Hamsters
1

// Total Number Of Animals
6 + 5 + 2 + 1

// Total Number Of Mammals
6 + 5 + 1

This playground definitely helped you solve your friend’s problem. You kept track of the number of each kind of animal, the total number of animals, and the total number of mammals.

But as you did the experiment, you might have noticed it was easy to make a mistake. You had to change the number in multiple places. And if you forgot to update it everywhere, your totals would be wrong.

You also had to remember which number tracked each kind of animal. Without the comment that identified each number, it’s difficult to keep things straight.

One of the most useful practices when writing code is giving something a name. Instead of repeating numbers that all refer to the same thing, you can give that thing a name — then use the name instead of the number in your code.

Next you’ll find out how to name things.
