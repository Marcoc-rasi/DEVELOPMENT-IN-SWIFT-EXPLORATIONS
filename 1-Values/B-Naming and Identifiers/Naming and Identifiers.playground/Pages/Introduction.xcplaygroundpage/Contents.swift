## Solving Problems
Programmers use whatever tools they have available to solve all kinds of problems.

As you move through this course, you’ll learn different ways to use code to solve problems and build great apps. You'll start small and simple with some basics. But as your skills and knowledge grow, you'll be able to do more and more with what you know.

As a programmer, you'll sometimes solve problems and write apps for yourself, but you might also help other people solve their problems. In addition to learning how to write code, you'll want to think about a wide variety of problems and imagine how you might solve them.

As you solve problems throughout this course, you’ll learn fundamental practices that will help you become a better programmer.
