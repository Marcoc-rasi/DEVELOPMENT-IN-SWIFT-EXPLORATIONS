# Values

In this unit, you’ll learn that all programming is about data, and you’ll begin to use numbers and letters to express and manipulate values to solve problems. You’ll consider how to name and describe different types of data, and consider how you can select and use values to simulate the real world.
You’ll explore these concepts in Xcode playgrounds, build a word game in a playground, and get started with Interface Builder to build and run your own app that displays a photo.
You’ll consider how computing innovations have changed people’s lives and how technology impacts people differently. At the same time, you’ll consider how to reduce bias in technology design, and how to protect your own and others’ copyrights. You’ll be introduced to the app design process and begin to shape your own app idea.
