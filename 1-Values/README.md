# `Values`

In this unit, you’ll learn that all programming is about data, and you’ll begin to use numbers and letters to express and manipulate values to solve problems. You’ll consider how to name and describe different types of data, and consider how you can select and use values to simulate the real world.
You’ll explore these concepts in Xcode playgrounds, build a word game in a playground, and get started with Interface Builder to build and run your own app that displays a photo.
You’ll consider how computing innovations have changed people’s lives and how technology impacts people differently. At the same time, you’ll consider how to reduce bias in technology design, and how to protect your own and others’ copyrights. You’ll be introduced to the app design process and begin to shape your own app idea.

# `Experimenting with Values`

## `A. Playground Basics`
Navigate your way around Xcode playgrounds and learn how to input and change code in basic programs.

## `B. Naming and Identifiers`
Learn about the importance of names in programming and build some simple programs to solve problems.

## `C. Simulation`
Learn about the features and applications of simulations and experiment with one.

## `D. Text Strings`
Learn about text strings and how to use them in your code to create a simple game.

## `E. Constants and Variables`
Learn how to declare variables and constants and build a program to keep track of a score.

## `Apply Your Creative Thinking
F. Word Games
Use your knowledge of values, constants, and strings to create and play word games in playgrounds.

## `G-PhotoFrame-Marcocrasi`

I added an image to my storyboard by dragging an "Image View" and assigning the desired image in the attributes panel. It's important to note that images must be added first to the Assets.xcassets folder in the project. To change the background color of the view, I selected the main view and adjusted the "Background" or "Background Color" property in the attributes panel.
