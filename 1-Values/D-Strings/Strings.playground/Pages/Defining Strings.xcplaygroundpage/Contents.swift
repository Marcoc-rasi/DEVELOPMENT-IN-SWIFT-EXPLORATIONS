## Defining Strings
In the Naming and Identifiers playground, you declared number constants like this:
 */
let heightInCentimeters = 7817
//: To declare a string constant, you put text between quotation marks like this:
let favoriteBook = "The Sun Also Rises"

let traditionalGreeting = "Hello, world!"
/*:
The declared string values also appear in the results sidebar. ðŸ‘‰

 - Experiment: Practice by declaring `favoriteMovie` and `favoriteSong` string constants for your favorite movie and song:
 */
// Declare a favoriteMovie constant
let favoriteMovie = "Interestelar"
// Declare a favoriteSong constant
let favoriteSong = "Pettite Bull - Josman"

/*:
Next, take a string-based trip around the world.
