## Exercise: Making a List
 
 Lists are great. Here are some constants that describe some of the things youâ€™ve learned about strings so far:

let constants = "Declaring string constants"
let unicode = "Unicode characters (ðŸ˜Ž)"
let combining = "Combining strings using +"
let interpolation = "String interpolation (aka Fill in the Blanks)"
let escaping = "Escape characters for \"special powers\""
let newline = "Making new lines"
//:  - Experiment: Make a new string constant that lists the things youâ€™ve learned about strings, with each item on a new line. Make sure you add the result to the playground page so that you can see the list properly.
let sentence = "Things i've learned about Strings\n\(constants)\n\(unicode)\n\(combining)\n\(interpolation)\n\(escaping)\n\(newline)\n"
