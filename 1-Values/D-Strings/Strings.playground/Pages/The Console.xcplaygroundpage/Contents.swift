## The Console

 As a programmer, you get to go behind the scenes, where you’ll see and do things that typical users don’t. One of those things is called the _console_. It has its origin in the days when the only kind of computer interaction was through typing and viewing text.

 You probably know the word console in the context of video games and TV stands. In programming, though, the console is a message center that can show details about the way a program is running.

### Showing the Console
 Show the console by clicking this button in the bottom right of the Xcode window:

 ![Console Button](console_button.png)

 The console is part of the Debug area, which you can show by choosing **View > Debug Area > Show Debug Area** from the menu or by pressing **Shift-Command-Y** (**Shift-⌘-Y**).

 Show and hide the console a few times, just to practice, but leave the console showing when you’re done.

 To adjust the height of the console, move your mouse to the bar at the top of the console until you see the cursor change to a horizontal bar with up and down arrows, then drag it.

 ### Printing

 The `print` command tells a Swift program to send a message to the console. You can use it with a string like this:

 `print("Testing, one two three.")`

 - callout(Exercise): Try printing a few strings below.

print("i'm Marcos")
print ("I'm engineer")
