## More Than Strings
String interpolation is a powerful way to build strings. In addition to substituting string values, you can substitute in other values, such as numbers or even calculations.

let goalieName = "Alison"
let firstHalfSaves = 3
let secondHalfSaves = 6
let overtimeSaves = 2
let goalieReportString = "At the game yesterday, \(goalieName) had \(firstHalfSaves) saves in the first half, \(secondHalfSaves) in the second half and \(overtimeSaves) saves in overtime, for a total of \(firstHalfSaves + secondHalfSaves + overtimeSaves) saves."

 - Experiment: People have been playing fill-in-the-blank games for a long time. You can create a basic version of this kind of game in the playground:
   - Make up a short fill-in-the-blank story, or use the one below.
   - Create a string or number constant for every blank.
   - Use string interpolation to fill in the blanks in the story.

    Sample story: “Today was a big day for <name>. They had finally saved up <number> dollars and were going to buy a <adjective> <noun>. They went to the <noun> <place> feeling very <positive emotion>. But then they felt <negative emotion>. They were all out of <noun>!”

// Add your version of the story below
let name = "Carolina"
let numberDollars = 20
let adjetiveOfTheThingToBuy = "Black"
let thingToBuy = "iPad"
let nounOfThePlace = "big"
let place = "MIT Campus"
let positiveEmotion = "Excited"
let negativeEmotion = "Sad"
let nounStore = "Stock"
let sampleHistory = "Today was a big day for \(name). They had finally saved up \(numberDollars) dollars and were going to buy a \(adjetiveOfTheThingToBuy) \(thingToBuy). They went to the \(nounOfThePlace) \(place) feeling very \(positiveEmotion). But then they felt \(negativeEmotion). They were all out of \(nounStore)!"
