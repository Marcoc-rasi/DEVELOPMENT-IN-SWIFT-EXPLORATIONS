## Characters
Of course, text can contain more than just letters. It can also includes punctuation marks, numbers, symbols, even spaces — all known as _characters_. All _strings_ are made up of _characters_.

Letters are characters:
## Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee
So are punctuation marks:
## ! ? . , ; :
Numbers:
## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
Symbols:
## # @ $ & © π * + - /
Even invisible characters like spaces and tabs:\
_(You can’t see them, but they’re there.)_
## `                         `

Properly defined, a `String` is a *sequence of characters*, a set of things in a particular order, just like the beads on the previous page.

Now that you know about the pieces, it’s time to build some strings.\
