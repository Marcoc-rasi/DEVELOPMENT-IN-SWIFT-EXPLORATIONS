## Combining Strings
Programmers often need to put several strings together.

For example, you might see a message like _Chris likes your post_ in a social media app.

In Swift, you can combine strings by adding them together, also known as *concatenation*.
 */
// This might change over time
let username = "Chris"

// This part of the message will get reused
let likesYourPostMessage = "likes your post"

// Concatenate strings by using the plus sign
let finishedMessage = username + " " + likesYourPostMessage
/*:
You can see how the strings have been combined in the results sidebar. 👉

What happens if you don’t add the space between the two strings?

 - Experiment: Declare `firstName` and `lastName` string constants for your first and last name.\
Concatenate them into a `fullName` constant.\
Concatenate your `fullName` and `likesYourPostMessage`.\
Type each line of code below the relevant comment below.
 */
// Declare a firstName constant
let fisrtName = "Marcos"
// Declare a lastName constant
let lastName = "Martinez"
// Combine the strings into a fullName constant
let fullName = fisrtName + " " + lastName
// Combine your full name with likesYourPostMessage
let finishMessageWhitMyName = fullName + " " + likesYourPostMessage
print(finishMessageWhitMyName)
