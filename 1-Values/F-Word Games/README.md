# Creatively apply your thinking
## Word Games
### Introduction
You've learned about strings and how they work together with variables and constants to let you do all sorts of things with text. Coding is impossible without declaring names for values, and strings are an essential kind of data found in almost all code, so these are foundational skills you'll use constantly. Now it's time to use some of your knowledge in the service of creativity, self expression, and humor.

# Challence yourself
Word games are a fun way to express yourself and amuse others.

In this lesson's playground, you'll challenge your peers to play a word-substitution game that results in funny stories. You'll need to use your knowledge of declaring constants and variables, as well as string escape characters, concatenation and interpolation.
