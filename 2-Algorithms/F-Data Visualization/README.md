# Data Visualization
## Introduction
You've learned about functions, types, and parameters, and you applied your knowledge in a simple API with BoogieBot. Now it's time to tackle something a little more challenging: displaying charts and graphs of different data.


## Challenge Yourself
The `API` in this playground gives you the capability to display data visualizations of three different kinds: pie charts, bar charts, and scatter plots.
You'll learn how to use a number of functions with parameters to set up these visualizations. You may have built charts and graphs before using a spreadsheetâ€”now's your chance to try using nothing but your Swift coding skills.
