## Plots

 Scatter plots are the third type of data visualization supported by the API. A scatter plot is the perfect choice when you want to show the relationship, or correlation, between two different variables. Scatter plots work best with many data points.

 Imagine, for example, you want to visualize the weight and the height of all the students in your class. Each dot on the plot represents a single data point—in this case, an individual student. The two variables, weight and height, determine the placement of the student's dot on the X and Y axes. How do the points scatter across the plot? Does there seem to be a correlation between weight and height?

 The `addPointAt(x:y:color:)` function plots a point.

- `x`: The X coordinate of the point.
- `y`: The Y coordinate of the point.
- `color`: The color of the point. You can use any one of the following values. (Remember to use a period before the color name.)
    - .black
    - .blue
    - .brown
    - .cyan
    - .darkGray
    - .gray
    - .green
    - .lightGray
    - .magenta
    - .orange
    - .purple
    - .red
    - .yellow

 The plot on this page has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 10 for both axes. Points outside these ranges won't show up on the plot.

 Below is an example use of the API.

 - Experiment: Try modifying the parameters to see how they affect the look of the chart. Also try adding more points.
