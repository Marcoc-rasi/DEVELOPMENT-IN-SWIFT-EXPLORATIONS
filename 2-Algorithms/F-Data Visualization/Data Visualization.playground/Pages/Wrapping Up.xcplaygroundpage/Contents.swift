## Wrapping Up
 
 In this playground, you learned how to visualize data in three different forms. Pie charts allow you to visualize each element's connection to the whole. Bar charts allow you to easily compare different elements of our data. Plots are useful for viewing the relationship, or correlation, between two different variables. They are often used to illustrate how a particular variable has changed over time. Using visualizations can help us to visually classify and compare data elements, leading to new insights and knowledge. You'll do more with visualization as you proceed through this course.
