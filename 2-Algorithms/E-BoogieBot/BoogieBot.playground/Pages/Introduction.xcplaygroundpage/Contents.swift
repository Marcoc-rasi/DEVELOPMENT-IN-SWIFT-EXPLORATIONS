## BoogieBot

 In this playground you’ll get to know BoogieBot, a dancing robot.

 You’ll use your knowledge of functions to make BoogieBot dance by calling existing functions. Then you’ll define functions of your own to create dance routines.

 Finally, you’ll add a text title, sign your work, and save it as an animated version of the static image below:

 Next, find out how to configure your playground so it's ready to see some dancing.
