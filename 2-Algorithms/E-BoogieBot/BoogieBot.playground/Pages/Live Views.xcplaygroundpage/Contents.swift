## Live Views
 
 Live views are a playground feature that let you see instant updates to your work, without having to add inline results as you did in the Strings playground. Live views also allow you to play with animation.
 
 This playground has some special behind-the-scenes features to give it BoogieBot capabilities. These features wonâ€™t work in other playgrounds.
 
 Before you get started, make sure your playground is set up to work with live views. The following line of code sets up BoogieBot and makes it dance:

runBoogieBotDemoMode()

 The live view shows up in the **live view** on the right. ðŸ‘‰
 
 If you donâ€™t see anything there, choose Editor > Live View. The editor area should now be divided in two, with the live view appearing on the right.
 
 You can also show the live view by using the Adjust Editor Options button in the top right of the window and selecting Live View.
