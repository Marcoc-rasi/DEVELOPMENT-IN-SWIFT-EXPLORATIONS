# BoogieBot
## Introduction
In this lesson, you’ll to step away from strings and numbers and make friends with BoogieBot, a dancing robot that you can control using functions. You’ll get to make up your own dance routines, add text to your creations, and save them as animated images.

## Challenge Yourself
So far, most of your work with playgrounds has resulted in displaying simple values or printing them to the console. But coding is about much more than just numbers and text—a fact in evidence any time you unlock your iPhone.
In this playground, you'll get your second opportunity to use Live Views, which give you new forms of output to play with. You'll use your knowledge of functions and procedural abstraction to create art—and maybe get a laugh or two.
