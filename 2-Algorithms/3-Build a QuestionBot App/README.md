# Question Bot

This code is for an iOS application that provides users with a straightforward conversational experience. The core of the application is the `ViewController` class, which serves as the primary view controller.

When users open the app, the `viewDidLoad()` method is automatically called, initiating the activation of the `questionField` text input, enabling users to start typing their questions right away.

Subsequently, when a user types a question and taps the "Ask" button, the `askButtonTapped(_:)` method is invoked. This method checks if the text input is not empty, and, if it isn't, it hides the keyboard using `questionField.resignFirstResponder()`, allowing the code to proceed.

The user's input question is sent to the `respondToQuestion(_:)` method, which leverages an instance of `MyQuestionAnswerer` to produce a response. The response engine, `MyQuestionAnswerer`, implements conditional response rules: if the question begins with certain keywords such as "hello there," "where should I go on holiday," "where can I find the North Pole," or "where are the cookies," it returns specific responses. If the question doesn't match these patterns, it performs a more generalized analysis. If the question's length is an odd number of characters, it responds with a default message indicating the complexity of the question. When the question's length is even, it provides another default response indicating that the answer is unknown.

The generated response from `MyQuestionAnswerer` is displayed on the `responseLabel` user interface element, delivering the answer to the user. The "Ask" button is temporarily disabled to prevent repeated questions, and the placeholder text in `questionField` changes to encourage the user to ask another question.

Additionally, the extension of `ViewController` conforms to `UITextFieldDelegate` to manage events related to the text input. It handles actions like hiding the keyboard when the "Return" key is pressed and dynamically enabling or disabling the "Ask" button based on whether there is text in the input field. This enhances the usability and user interaction.

In summary, this code creates a simple conversational interface where users can pose questions and receive responses using a custom response engine. The user interface responds effectively to user interactions, and the underlying logic is encapsulated within the `MyQuestionAnswerer` structure.
