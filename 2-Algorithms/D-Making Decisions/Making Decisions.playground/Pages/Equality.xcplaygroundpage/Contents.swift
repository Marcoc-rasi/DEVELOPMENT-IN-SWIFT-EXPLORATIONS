## Equality
 
 You’ve learned that `true` and `false` are special values. Without typing in `Bool`s directly (which isn’t really making a decision), how do you ask questions in code? One way is by making _comparison statements_.
 
 Comparison statements say something, and Swift will say if that something is `true` or `false`. A comparison statement has three parts: 
 1. This…
 2. has a relationship to…
 3. that
 
 Parts 1 and 3 are values, like the numbers and strings you’ve already been working with. Part 2 is something new: a _comparison operator_. Here’s an example:
 */
1 == 2
/*:
 The double equal sign `==`, or _equality operator_, checks if the left-hand and right-hand sides of the statement are equal. In this case, they’re not equal, so the statement is false.

 - Note: You can’t use a single equal sign `=` for a comparison because it’s already used for assigning a value, as you learned in previous playgrounds.

 The following slightly more complicated example statement is `true`:
 */
10 == 9 + 1
/*:
It makes sense that the equality operator has lower precedence than arithmetical ones—you want to evaluate all expressions on either side before making the comparison.

Named values can also be used in comparisons:
 */
let hundred = 100
let tenTimesTen = 10 * 10
let nineTimesTen = 9 * 10

hundred == tenTimesTen
hundred == nineTimesTen
//:  - Experiment: Try some comparisons of your own. Can you check if two string values are equal?
let name1 = "Marcos"
let name2 = "Marcus"
name1 == name1
name1 == name2
