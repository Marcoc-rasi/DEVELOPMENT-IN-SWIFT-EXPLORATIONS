# Making Decisions

## What You'll Build
A program to determine if a given year is a leap year.

## What You'll Learn
- How to compare values.
- How to use the results of comparisons to choose which lines of code to execute in your applications.

## Key Vocabulary
- `Boolean`: A data type representing two possible values: `true` or `false`.
- `Comparison Operators`: Symbols that allow you to compare two values, such as equality (`==`), inequality (`!=`), greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), etc.
- `Conditional Statement`: A structure that allows you to execute different code blocks based on a condition.
- `Remainder Operator, %`: An operator that returns the remainder of the division between two numbers.
- `if Statement`: A conditional structure that executes a code block if a condition is true.
- `if-else Statement`: A conditional structure that executes one code block if a condition is true and another if it's false.
- `else if`: An extension of the if-else statement to evaluate multiple conditions sequentially.
