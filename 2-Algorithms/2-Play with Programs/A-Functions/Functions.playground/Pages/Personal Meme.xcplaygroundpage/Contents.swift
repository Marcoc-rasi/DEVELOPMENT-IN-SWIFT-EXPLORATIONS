## Personal Meme
 
 Copy the functions you made in the previous exercise to this page or write them out again for practice. Or even make a whole new set.

 Inside one of the functions, make changes so that the text means something different, or make it funnier. You could change a name to your name or a friend’s name, change a word to something else that rhymes, or just play around.
