## Remainder Operator
 
 Your band hired that extra member and has gone on tour. But there’s more trouble.
 
 They insist on a bowl of candy in the dressing room every night. If it doesn’t divide exactly between all of them, they’ll quit. 
 
 Remember from your first playground that you can use the _remainder operator_ to find out if one number divides evenly into another. Can the candy be split evenly among your band members? Check if the remainder is zero:
 */
let bandMemberCount = 6
let candyCount = 79
if candyCount % bandMemberCount == 0 {
    "Rock on."
} else {
    "Everyone quits! This is unacceptable!"
}
//: When reading the code, it’s not completely clear what’s happening. The `%` and `== 0` distract from the question that the code is asking. To make it clearer, you could put the code inside a function:
func isCandyAmountAcceptable(bandMemberCount: Int, candyCount: Int) -> Bool {
    return candyCount % bandMemberCount == 0
}
//: As in the previous example, this approach hides the complexity of what’s happening in the function. You can then write the following code:
if isCandyAmountAcceptable(bandMemberCount: bandMemberCount, candyCount: candyCount) {
    "Rock on."
} else {
    "Everyone quits! This is unacceptable!"
}

> In some other programming languages `%` is called the modulo operator and has different behavior for negative numbers.
