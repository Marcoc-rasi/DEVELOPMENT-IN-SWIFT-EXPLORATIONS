## Exercise: Leap Years
 
 To decide if a year is a leap year, there are several decisions that have to be made in the correct order.
 
- Is the year divisible by 4?
    - If so, is the year divisible by 100?
        - If so, is the year divisible by 400?
            - If so, it is a leap year.
            - If not, it is **not** a leap year.
        - If it's not divisible by 100, it is a leap year.
    - If it's not divisible by 4, it is **not** a leap year.
 
 These decisions can be made inside a function as a series of nested `if...else` statements.
 
 The `number(_:, isDivisibleBy:)` function has been built into this playground to make this exercise easier. Below is an incomplete function for deciding if a given year is a leap year:
 */
func isLeapYear(_ year: Int) -> Bool {
    // Is the year divisible by 4?
    if number(year, isDivisibleBy: 4) {
        if number(year, isDivisibleBy: 100){
            if number(year, isDivisibleBy: 400){
                return true
            }else{
                return false
            }
        }else{
            return true
        }
    } else {
        return false
    }
}

// Should be true
isLeapYear(2000)
// Should be false
isLeapYear(1900)
// Should be true
isLeapYear(2012)
// Should be false
isLeapYear(2017)

/*:
 - callout(Exercise): Complete the function above so that the rules are all followed and the examples get the correct answers.
 \
_**Hint**_: Try using the rules as pseudocode by making them into comments. Then write the code that goes with each comment underneath it.
 */
/*:
 - callout(Exercise): For a challenge, complete the function below. It should behave identically without using any nested conditional statements.
 Use a single level of if/else statements along with conditionals that use Boolean operators.
 \
_**Hint**_: Create constants that represent the three key conditions, and then compose a Boolean expression with those constants.
 */

func isLeapYear2(_ year: Int) -> Bool {
    let condition1 = number(year, isDivisibleBy: 4)
    let condition2 = number(year, isDivisibleBy: 100)
    let condition3 = number(year, isDivisibleBy: 400)
    if condition1 && condition2 && condition3 {
        return true
    }else if condition1 && !condition2{
        return true
    }else{
        return false
    }
}
// Should be true
isLeapYear2(2000)
// Should be false
isLeapYear2(1900)
// Should be true
isLeapYear2(2012)
// Should be false
