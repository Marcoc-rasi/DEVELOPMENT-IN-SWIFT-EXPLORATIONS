## Getting Values Back
 
 In addition to using values that youâ€™ve passed in, functions can do their work and hand you back a value as a result.
 
 Passing a value back when a function is finished is called _returning_ a value. To declare a function that returns a value, you have to add two things to your code.
 
 After your list of parameters, add a text arrow `->` and the type of value to be returned. For example:
 `-> String` means the function returns a `String`.
 
 Then you have to end the body of the function with a return statement that gives that type of value back.
 
 Hereâ€™s a function that takes some numbers, does some work, and returns a string:
 */
func spaceAvailableMessage(eachVideoDuration: Int, numberOfVideos: Int) -> String {
    let currentSpace = 10000
    let megabytesPerVideoSecond = 3
    let spaceAvailable = currentSpace - eachVideoDuration * numberOfVideos * megabytesPerVideoSecond

    return "If your \(numberOfVideos) videos are \(eachVideoDuration) seconds each, you'll have \(spaceAvailable) MBs remaining"
}
spaceAvailableMessage(eachVideoDuration: 10, numberOfVideos: 50)
/*:
> Your function can have multiple parameters, but it can only return **one** value.

The value that a function returns is just like any other. It can be assigned to a variable or a constant and can be used for other work. Variables and constants can also be used as the arguments:
 */
let desiredVideoDuration = 40
let holidayVideoCount = 100
let videoMessage = spaceAvailableMessage(eachVideoDuration: desiredVideoDuration, numberOfVideos: holidayVideoCount)
let namedVideoMessage = "Hey Micah! \(videoMessage)"
/*:
Recall that the definition of an *expression* is something that produces a value. You encountered mathematical expressions like `2 + 6` as your first concept in Swift. And you learned that value literals are the simplest form of expression. A function call is another example of an expression, because it's evaluated and produces a value. Anywhere you can use a value, you can use a function.

 - callout(Exercise): Try making your own function that returns a value.

func addNumbers(number1: Int, number2: Int, number3: Int) -> Int {
     number1 + number2 + number3
}
print(addNumbers(number1: 3, number2: 6, number3: 89))
