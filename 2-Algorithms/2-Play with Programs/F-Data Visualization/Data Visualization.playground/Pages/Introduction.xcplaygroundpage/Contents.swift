## Data Visualization
 
 People often use visuals such as tables, charts, diagrams, and flowcharts to help them to gain insights from data, or to better understand the story being told. In the BoogieBot playground, you learned about using APIs to accomplish tasks. In this playground, you'll learn an API to visualize information in three forms: pie charts, bar charts, and scatter plots. Each visualization form tells a different story.
 
 To prepare for this playground, you'll need to gather some data to visualize. But since each visualization form serves a different purpose, you'll probably want to pull together three sets of data to create your charts.
 
 On the next page, you'll get started with pie charts.
 
 Important: Before you continue, make sure the assistant editor is showing the Live View in the right-hand side of the window.
