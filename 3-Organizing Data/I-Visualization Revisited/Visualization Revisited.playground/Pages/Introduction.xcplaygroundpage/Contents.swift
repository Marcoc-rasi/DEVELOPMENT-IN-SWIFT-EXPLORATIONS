## Data Visualization, Revisited
 
 In the first visualization playground, you learned an API for visualizing data. You used functions like `addWedge(proportion:color:)` to set up your charts. Now that you know more about Swift code, you’re ready for a new visualization API. This time around, you'll do things a bit differently—by using structs and enums. In fact, the API you learned earlier was just a thin abstraction layer on top of this new one. The API you'll learn now will strip away that layer so you can work directly with the items underneath.
 
 To prepare for using the new API, you'll need to have several data sets on hand. If you want, you can reuse the data from your first visualization playground. But you might want to create (or find online) some new data to play with.
 
 Important: Before you continue, make sure the assistant editor is showing the Live View in the right-hand side of the window.
 
 On the next page, you'll get started with pie charts.
