# Pixel Art
## Introduction
So far in this course, you've tried your hand at various forms of art. In this lesson, you'll have new tools to wield in the service of creative expression. You'll harness the power of the humble pixelâ€”the root of all computer-generated imagery
## Challenge Yourself
Computer art is as old as computing, and pixels are almost as old.
These tiny components of digital images are often manipulated using abstractions, such as the views and image in your PhotoFrame project, or the wedges of your pie charts in the Visualization lesson. But it's also possible (and sometimes necessary) to process pixels one by one. This lesson will give you a chance to play around at the pixel-by-pixel end of the abstraction spectrum.
