# Build a BouncyBall App

## What You’ll Build
A game where players try to hit targets with a bouncing ball.

## What You’ll Learn
- What callbacks are and how they work.
- How to use a sophisticated API.
- How to employ incremental development to build a complex application piece by piece.
- How to refactor your code.

## Key Vocabulary
- **Incremental Development**: A software development strategy that involves building an application in stages, gradually increasing its capabilities, and testing the code at each step.
- **Callback**: A function passed as an argument to another function and executed after a specific event occurs.
- **Refactor**: The process of restructuring and improving existing code without changing its external behavior.

## Introduction
Until now, you've built simple applications with minimal code. In this lesson, you'll face the challenge of building a game that uses physics and touch interaction. It will look something like this:

In this lesson, you'll follow a common software development strategy called incremental development. You'll build the BouncyBall app in stages, each ending in a functional application. You'll run and test your code at each step, gradually increasing its capabilities.
You might think you could watch the game in the video and build the app all at once. But think again. It will be much easier to build the game step by step, increasing its complexity in manageable steps. Along the way, you can assess your
