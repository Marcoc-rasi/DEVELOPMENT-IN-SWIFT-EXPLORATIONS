# `Organizing Data`
In this unit, you’ll learn skills for organizing and processing data. You’ll learn more about types— including the methods and properties associated with a type—and how to create custom types with structs. You’ll also learn how to order data in arrays and how to process arrays using loops.
You’ll apply your knowledge by creating old-school pixel art and animations, extending the data visualizer you built earlier and creating an algorithm to determine password security. And you’ll build an interactive BouncyBall app with colorful shapes.
You’ll learn about computing innovations that have had unintended consequences, and consider the story behind some of the innovations that shape our lives today. You’ll build an interactive prototype of your app in Keynote, and draft a user experience survey which you’ll use later to test your prototype.

# `J-Build a BouncyBall App`

This iOS game app involves a ball bouncing within a shape, navigating obstacles to win. The controller handles setting up the game scene, managing alerts, and on-screen presentation.
