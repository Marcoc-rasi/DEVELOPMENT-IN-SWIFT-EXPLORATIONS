# Password Security
## Introduction
In this lesson, you'll apply your knowledge of arrays and loops to the problem of analyzing password security. It's a great way to practice your skills and to delve into a process you've seen many times online. 

## Challenge Yourself
Passwords are a fact of life—and, as a user, you should choose yours wisely. But the developers of an app or a service should help their users make good password choices.
Different sites have different rules, but they're all similar in nature—for example, most sites require that passwords have a minimum number of characters.
Get ready to step into the shoes of a developer tasked with protecting the security of user accounts. This kind of coding carries a lot of responsibility. If not done well, a password verification algorithm could allow users to choose insecure passwords, or it could frustrate users with too many rules.
