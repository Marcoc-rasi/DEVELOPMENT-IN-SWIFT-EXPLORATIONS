 ## Summary
 
 In most circumstances, programmers can use limited types like `Int` and `Double` without consequences. Imagine you're managing the number of messages in an email inbox, the number of friends in a social network, the airspeed of a plane, or the probability of an election result—no problem! But you won't be able to use even an `Int64` to represent the estimated number of stars in the universe.
 
 `Int` and `Double` are good examples of abstraction because they allow programmers to work with numbers without understanding how they're represented inside the computer. But the abstraction isn't perfect. (A computer scientist might call it a *leaky abstraction* because the internal details can leak out in some circumstances.) If you do run into these limitations, your code will fail to work—and it might even crash.
 
 Testing your code is one way to uncover these kinds of problems. But testing is important for verifying *all* your code. When you write a function, you should also write tests using defined inputs to ensure that your function is producing the expected outcomes. All good app developers use the results from testing to revise—and refine—their algorithms or programs.
