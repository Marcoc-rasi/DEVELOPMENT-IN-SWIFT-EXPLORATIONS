## Exercise: Defining Enums
 
 Get some practice defining your own enums. Remember the rules about naming enums and their cases. 

 - callout(Exercise): Define an enum for the compass directions: North, East, South, and West.
 */
enum CompassDirection {
    case north, east, south, west
}
//:  - callout(Exercise): Define an enum for jigsaw puzzle pieces: corner, edge, and middle.
enum Jigsaw {
    case corner, edge, middle
}
//:  - callout(Excercise): Define an enum for the playback modes in a music app: standard, repeat, repeat all, and shuffle.
// Can't use "repeat" since it's a unique keyword in Swift. repeatOne is a good candidate
enum PlayBackModes {
    case standard, repeatOne, repeatAll, shuffle
}
