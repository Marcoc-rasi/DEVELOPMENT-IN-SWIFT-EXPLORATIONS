## Brute-Force Guessing
 
 How long does it take to guess a password by brute force? It depends on its length and the kinds of characters it's known to contain. With long, complicated passwords, the algorithm for brute-force guessing takes unreasonably long to run.
 
 What does it mean for an algorithm to run in an unreasonable amount of time?
 
 Look at the code below. The `passwordIsCorrect(_:)` function acts as the login form for a hypothetical web service, returning `true` when the correct password is entered. The `guessPasswordOfThreeCharacters(containing:)` function uses a brute-force algorithm to try all possible combinations of the characters passed in.
 
 This function is used below to guess a purely numeric password. Looking at the results bar on the right, you'll notice it guesses the correct password on the 124th try.

import Foundation

func passwordIsCorrect(_ password: String) -> Bool {
    return password == "1234"
}

let digits = "0123456789"
let punctuation = "!@#$%^&*(),.<>;'`~[]{}\\|/?_-+= "
let lowercaseAlphas = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
let uppercaseAlphas = lowercaseAlphas.uppercased()

func guessPasswordOfThreeCharacters(containing characters: String) {
    var password: String = ""
    
    for a in characters {
        for b in characters {
            for c in characters {
                for d in characters {
                    password = String(a) + String(b) + String(c) + String(d)
                    if passwordIsCorrect(password) {
                        print("Found password: \(password)")
                        // The return statement below means that the function exits
                        // early when the password is guessed, rather than executing
                        // all loops to completion.
                        return
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

guessPasswordOfThreeCharacters(containing: "283283")
/*:
 Try passing in a different character set to `guessPasswordOfThreeCharacters(containing:)` by combining the arrays above. For example, you can pass in `digits + lowercaseAlphas` to check for all digits and lowercase letters.
 
 Here are some questions to think about (the answers may differ depending on the set of characters you use):
 
- How many calculations are needed for the password "456" when checking only digits?
- How many calculations are needed for the password "456" when checking digits and lowercase letters?
- Does it matter in which order the arrays are combined?
- What is the maximum number of calculations needed if a password can contain characters of all types listed above?
- Which password can be guessed on the first try?
- Which password requires the most tries before it can be guessed?
 */
//guessPasswordOfThreeCharacters(containing: digits + lowercaseAlphas)
/*:
 Based on the password you choose to set in `checkPassword(_:)` and the order you supply the characters to guess, you can see that—even with just three characters—your playground can run for a very long time before finding a result.

 Because the algorithm contains a loop within a loop within a loop, you have to multiply the iterations of each loop to calculate the number of times the innermost statement executes. As a result, the algorithm is *exponential*. It operates as a function of the power of the number of possible characters. In the initial example, a password with just 10 possible characters of length 3, the number of possible passwords is 10³, or 1,000. If you lengthen the password by just one character, you need to add a new loop—and the possibilities increase to 10⁴, or 10,000.

 Exponential algorithms are said to run in *unreasonable time* because the time for them to run grows very quickly as the problem size increases. Try the challenge below to get a feel for what unreasonable time feels like to a user.

 - callout(Challenge): 
 Make of copy the `guessPasswordOfThreeCharacters(containing:)` function below and rename it to `guessPasswordOfFourCharacters(containing:)`. Modify it to guess passwords of four characters by adding another `for` loop.\
 \
 Modify the `passwordIsCorrect(_:)` function to contain a four-character password. Try using your new password-guessing function to see how it affects how long your playground runs before it finds a password. (Hint: you should comment out any existing calls to `guessPasswordOfThreeCharacters` on this page to avoid extraneous work.)
