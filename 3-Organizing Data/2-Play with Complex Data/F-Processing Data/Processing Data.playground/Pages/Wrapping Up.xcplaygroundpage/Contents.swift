## Wrapping Up

 Outside the confines of their code, developers have to contend with the real world in all its messiness. When it comes to data, you'll often find that what you get isn't what you expect. Sometimes the data is incomplete, or needs to be combined with other data sources to present a complete picture. Even when a data set is complete, sometimes it has to be cleaned in order to use it properly. Cleaning data can take several forms depending on its nature. (And knowing how to code makes it possible to clean data much more efficiently than if you had to do it by hand.)
 
 Cleaning data is one way to transform it—to make it more suitable to the task at hand, or more accurate. Beyond transformation, you can translate data by putting it into new contexts or deriving extra information from it.
 
 You've also learned the value of using third-party code and the proper way to cite it. If you hadn't paid attention before, you'll surely notice now that the license on this page (and on the final page of all the playgrounds in this course) is identical to the license for the third-party code you used.
