## Third-Party Code
  
  Calculating the degree of difference between strings is a well-known challenge in computer science. One of the great things about computer science is that many common problems have already been solved elegantly and efficiently.
  
  The function below determines the *edit distance* between two strings—the degree of difference between them. It's based on a well-known algorithm named Wagner-Fischer. Lots of programmers share their code with the world, and a Swift implementation of this algorithm exists [right here](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club/tree/master/Minimum%20Edit%20Distance).
 
 Programmers often use existing algorithms as building blocks when they create their own algorithms. And it's common to use code that was authored by somebody else. But when you do, make sure to follow these important steps:
 
 1. Verify that the code has a license that allows you to use it.
 2. If the license requires you to cite the source, make sure to comply.
 
 Notice that the Swift code for edit distance below is properly cited—the license from its [license page](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) is included, as required by the license terms. A citation should include the origin or the author's name.
 
 It's unlikely you'll understand the code below, but you don't need to in order to complete this exercise. It's not bad practice to use code you don't completely understand—as long as you know it's been well tested and comes from a reputable source.
